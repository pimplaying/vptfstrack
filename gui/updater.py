"""
Self-update mechanism, built around GitHub Releases.

How it works:
  1. On startup, apply_pending_update_and_maybe_restart() checks whether a
     previously-downloaded update is waiting next to the running exe. If so,
     it hands off to a small batch script that waits for this process to
     exit, swaps the files, and relaunches — this is necessary because
     Windows won't let a running .exe overwrite itself.
  2. check_for_update() asks the GitHub API for the latest release and
     compares its tag against CURRENT_VERSION.
  3. apply_update() downloads the new .exe asset and stores it as a
     "*_pending.exe" file next to the current one, ready for step 1 on the
     NEXT app launch (we deliberately don't force an immediate restart —
     the GUI just tells the user an update is ready).

SETUP REQUIRED: fill in GITHUB_REPO below with "owner/repo-name" once your
repo exists, and make sure your GitHub Releases include a built .exe as an
attached asset (see gui/BUILD.md for how to build + publish one).
